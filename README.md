Hello everyone,

I'm a software engineer and this is my configuration. I'm using Macbook Pro 13' 2020 intel CPU.

Oh, before we go the configuration, let's me show you guys my story:

I'm a lazy programmer but not a lazy person. I'd like to set up configuration and environment for working in my new machine :D. That's great right.

I've changed my laptop 3 or 4 times (I don't remember :(). When I'm a high school guy, then go to University, and now I'm at work. Not to mention I switched companies about 2-3 times. Every new company, they've given me a new laptop. Feel very happy and exciting to be received a new one :). And I'm like a hard-working bee, do it and do it again (the configuration stuff).

Switched to a new laptop meaning that all setups are lost. Not lost all, I still remember some core apps, plugins that enough to work. But to be really comfortable to work. I need exactly the same settings, the same configurations that I've got on my old laptop. And after spent 4-5 hours or even a whole day. My new laptop finally is configured and ready for a new journey.

Then I realized that why don't keep all of my configurations, all of the stuff that I need in only one location? With some documentation, guides step by step on how to set up. I think that is much better and I can easy to set up without missing anything.

So that's why I created this repo to save all my configuration then one day I got another new laptop. I don't worried about the configuration stuff anymore :)

I still learning new things and this repo help me so much. I find something new and useful. I'll put it to this repo.

> Never put any line of code that you don't understand in your own configuration. Because it might hurt you and mess things up without you even knowing it ;)

Thanks for reading !!!
